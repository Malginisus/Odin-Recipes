        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gelato is the common word in Italian for all kinds of ice cream. In English, it specifically refers to a frozen dessert of Italian origin. Artisanal gelato in Italy generally contains 6â€“9% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert.<br><br>In Italian, gelato is the generic word for ice cream and means simply "frozen", independent of the style, so every kind of ice cream is referred to as such. In English, however, the term has come to be used to refer to a specific style of ice cream derived from the Italian artisanal tradition.</p>
